            Welcome Pilot! It's your job to get your ship from where it is to
            where it needs to go. Let's take a look into all the engines and
            controls you use to do that.

            This is your pilot radar. It shows the relative direction and
            distance from your ship to nearby objects in 3D space.


            Your ship is in the very center, with the arrow pointing in the same
            direction as your ship. As your ship turns and rotates, you'll see
            the objects in this radar move with your ship. 


            It is **crucial** to remember that you are seeing a 2D projection of
            3D space. Objects might be above or below your ship. Go to the next
            step to find out how to see what objects are above or below you.

            Excellent work. You can also tilt the sensor grid to give you a 3D
            view of space. There are three levels of tilt: directly above, 45˚
            behind, and 90˚ behind. At the 90˚ tilt, your ship appears to move
            _into_ the the radar, while up and down correspond to above and
            below your ship.


            Go ahead and switch the tilt to 90˚ behind by clicking the tilt
            button twice.

            Enough looking at radars. Let's start moving the ship around. Most
            commonly, you'll use these thrusters to rotate your ship to point in
            the direction you want to go.


            Your thrusters can rotate your ship along three axes. Pitch rotates
            the nose of your ship up and down. Roll rotates the sides of your
            ship up and down. The slider underneath yaws your ship by turning
            the nose to the left (port) or the right (starboard).

            Play around with the rotation thrusters for a few seconds. Notice
            how little lines appear along the edges of the radar when you
            activate thrusters, to give a visual indication that your ship is
            rotating, even if there are no reference objects nearby.


            Training will continue when you've used the thrusters for a few
            moments.

            You also have thrusters which move your ship laterally in 6
            different directions. These thrusters don't provide a lot of speed,
            and are used for precise movements.


            The circle joystick lets you move up, down, port (left), and
            starboard (right). This is useful when you need to carefully
            navigate around ships or other navigational hazards.


            The slider on the left lets you thrust forward or reverse.

            Note that if you choose Destructive, the engines will attempt to use
            all of the power allocated to them. This can make your engines go
            faster than designed, but can also cause them to overheat or become
            damaged, so use caution.

            Setting the waypoint brings us back to the radar, where you can see
            a new orange icon. That points in the direction of the waypoint that
            you just set.


            To travel to that waypoint, you'll need to use your yaw, pitch, and
            roll thrusters so your ship is pointed at that waypoint arrow.
            You'll know you're pointed in the right direction when the arrow
            turns blue.


            Here's a hint: Set your radar view to be top-down. Then use Yaw to
            rotate your ship so the waypoint arrow is at the top of the radar. 
            Then switch your radar view to be 90˚ behind and use the Pitch to
            rotate your ship so the waypoint arrow overlaps with the front of
            your ship. If it still doesn't line up, you can use Yaw again to get
            it in just the right location.

            Your waypoints appear here, with the active waypoint highlighted. If
            there were more waypoitns here, you could change the active waypoint
            by clicking on a different waypoint. You can also remove waypoints
            that you've created if your list gets too crowded.

            There are a few extra things unrelated to the Pilot station. The
            first is your officers log, which you can open by clicking this
            button. Feel free to use it to write down notes, ideas, or thoughts
            during the mission.

            This will show you your ships current objectives, which can be
            helpful to know what your team needs to do next.

            Finally, this is the settings for your station, where you can
            configure audio volume levels and gamepads which you can use to
            control your station. This can be especially handy for the Pilot,
            since it allows you to connect joysticks or HOTAS controllers to
            activate engines and manipulate thrusters.

            That concludes your training. If you don't feel confident, feel free
            to play around with your controls further until you've mastered
            using your engines, thrusters, and navigation.


            Good luck!
